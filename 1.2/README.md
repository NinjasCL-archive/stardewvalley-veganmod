# For Stardew Valley 1.2

## Stardew Valley Vegan Mod
This mode enables completing the Community Center Arc without needed animal products
like milk, cheese or fish.

This was made because I'm vegan and I wanted to complete the game in a vegan way, no fishing no farm animals and no food with animal ingredients. And of course not using the Joja Corporation path because they are evil and expensive.

## Installation
Copy `Bundles.xnb` replacing the file in `Data/Bundles.xnb` inside the StarDew Valley files.

### Available Languages
 If you want to use another language you can copy `Bundles.{language}.xnb` file instead.

* English `Bundles.xnb`
* Spanish `Bundles.es-ES.xnb`
* German  `Bundles.de-DE.xnb` (thanks [martin21](https://github.com/martin21))

**Important**

 - Backup your files.
 - Use at your own risk.
 - This is beta, may crash the game. Currently tested on `v1.2`. Please report any issues.

If you want the detail of whatÂ´s different you could see the `Bundles.json` file.
