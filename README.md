# Stardew Valley Vegan Mod
This mode enables completing the Community Center Arc without needed animal products
like milk, cheese or fish.

Also adds vegan related dialogs on Emily (when married).

This was made because I'm vegan and I wanted to complete the game in a vegan way, no fishing no farm animals and no food with animal ingredients. And of course not using the Joja Corporation path because they are evil and expensive.

## Installation
Copy `Bundles.xnb` replacing the file in `Data/Bundles.xnb` and optionally do the same with `MarriageDialogueEmily.xnb` in `Characters\Dialogue` inside the StarDew Valley files.


**Important**
 - Backup your files.
 - Use at your own risk.
 - This is beta, may crash the game. Currently tested on v1.1. Please report any issues.

## Compiling

## What's Different?
The mod simply changes the Community Center Requirements and Prizes.

### Fall Crops Bundle
Replaced `Bee House` Prize for `Preserves Jar` as Honey is not Vegan.

### Quality Crops Bundle
Replaced `Preserver Jar` for `Iridium Sprinkler` Because Quality Crops deserve a better prize.

### Animal Bundle
Animal Bundle Renamed to `Treasures Bundle` requiring artifacts and gems to be completed.
The prize is now 150 `Hardwood`. Rather than the `Cheese Press` as Cheese is not Vegan.
