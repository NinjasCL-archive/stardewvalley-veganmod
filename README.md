# Stardew Valley Vegan Mod
This mode enables completing the Community Center Arc without needed animal products
like milk, cheese or fish.

This was made because I'm vegan and I wanted to complete the game in a vegan way, no fishing no farm animals and no food with animal ingredients. And of course not using the Joja Corporation path because they are evil and expensive.

## Versions

* [StardewValley 1.1](/1.1)
* [StardewValley 1.2](/1.2)

## How it was made?
Using the Community Center Modifier
